Alright.

There are bugs.

//i feel like i keep switching this from < to <= because it sometimes breaks but swapping it fixes that specific break. IF THIS HAPPENS AGAIN THIS COMMENT WILL BE PROOF AND I SHOULD FIX IT FOR REALSIES

I switched it because an older save string was literally crashing rather than working with default values like it should have.

But now, I'm getting bug reports like:


"speaking of not intentional, wings don't actually save in the dollsim. like, at all.
 they just get exported like it never happened.
"

and

"Face paint refuses to save on dolls
 I put it on a doll and then when I load the doll's url or save it the face paint is gone
 which sucks because"

 and "they are duped" (???)

~~~~~~~

forgot I was working on this earlier.

Step 1: confirm the problem.

Can i make any layers (especially newest layer) stop rendering in save string?

Confirmation:  Kid loses facepaint.
