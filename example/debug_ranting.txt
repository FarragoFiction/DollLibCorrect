Alright.

There are bugs.

//i feel like i keep switching this from < to <= because it sometimes breaks but swapping it fixes that specific break. IF THIS HAPPENS AGAIN THIS COMMENT WILL BE PROOF AND I SHOULD FIX IT FOR REALSIES

I switched it because an older save string was literally crashing rather than working with default values like it should have.

But now, I'm getting bug reports like:


"speaking of not intentional, wings don't actually save in the dollsim. like, at all.
 they just get exported like it never happened.
"

and

"Face paint refuses to save on dolls
 I put it on a doll and then when I load the doll's url or save it the face paint is gone
 which sucks because"

 and "they are duped" (???)

~~~~~~~

forgot I was working on this earlier.

Step 1: confirm the problem.

Can i make any layers (especially newest layer) stop rendering in save string?

Confirmation:  Kid loses facepaint.

~~~~~~~~

It's finally gotten to the point where i need to store images in  a single location, instead of locally
to each project.

*  make a shell script for transfering over all images to a   set location. DollSource/images/

* have dolls take in a bool (defaults to true) for 'absolute path'.

* ???

* profit

Virus dolls aren't loading properly. I'm stumped even after a good night's sleep. So it's time to bust out the
5 minutes on the clock problem definition thingy.

Problem:

When I make a doll it's string looks like:

ElD_NwH-_wH-k2v-mQH-NwGM0wD-bzmM-wD-szn-0yf__v7k5OQCAAAAAgICAA==

When I load that string it looks like:
ElD-NwH-_wH-k2v-mQH-NwGM0wD-bzmM-wD-szn-0yf__v4AAAACAAAAAA==

Basically, palette is perfect, but the sprite layers are NOT.

What gets rendered is:

Leg1: 0
Leg2: 0
Leg3: 0
Leg4: 1
DecoLegs: 0
Capsid: 0
Body: 0

What gets loaded is:

reading (Leg1), its 114
(program):1 reading (Leg2), its 114
(program):1 reading (Leg3), its 114
(program):1 reading (Leg4), its 1
(program):1 reading (DecoLegs), its 0
(program):1 reading (Capsid), its 0
(program):1 reading (Body), its 0

And what SHOULD be loaded is:

1000111.

So. Any patterns I see?

I see 4 1's in the source pattern, and 4 "not zeroes" in the read patterns. Hrm.
No feature is skipped.

What does 114 look like in binary? 01110010

Alright that doesn't have any obvious connections to 1...

If I change everything to "2" leg 4 remains 1 and everything else is zero...

What is going on?

reading (Leg1), its 114
VM180:1 reading (Leg2), its 114
VM180:1 reading (Leg3), its 114
VM180:1 reading (Leg4), its 2
VM180:1 reading (DecoLegs), its 2
VM180:1 reading (Capsid), its 2
VM180:1 reading (Body), its 2

Huh. there AREN'T two bodies. So something is getting twisted between reading and writing and those 114s
 are back again too.

 Let's print out some "toDataURL" or whatever text.


 saving to data bytes x
 adding Leg1  with value 1 to data string builder.
 adding Leg2  with value 2 to data string builder.
 adding Leg3  with value 1 to data string builder.
 adding Leg4  with value 2 to data string builder.
 adding DecoLegs  with value 2 to data string builder.
 adding Capsid  with value 0 to data string builder.
 adding Body  with value 0 to data string builder.

 http://localhost:63342/DollBuilder/web/index.html?ElD_ZzJ7McjwHn6YIEx4Gj5MEiiqKFR6HDzWEFKUEDA6rlwibjoCBAIEBAAAAA==

and then when loading it's:

reading (Leg1), its 17
VM187:1 reading (Leg2), its 55
VM187:1 reading (Leg3), its 29
VM187:1 reading (Leg4), its 1
VM187:1 reading (DecoLegs), its 2
VM187:1 reading (Capsid), its 1
VM187:1 reading (Body), its 2
VM187:1 saving to data bytes x
VM187:1 adding Leg1  with value 0 to data string builder.
VM187:1 adding Leg2  with value 0 to data string builder.
VM187:1 adding Leg3  with value 0 to data string builder.
VM187:1 adding Leg4  with value 1 to data string builder.
VM187:1 adding DecoLegs  with value 2 to data string builder.
VM187:1 adding Capsid  with value 1 to data string builder.
VM187:1 adding Body  with value 0 to data string builder.


To me this means there must be a byte coming or going somewhere....

where do I take out the type?

i see it happening in virus:



is the palette being weird?





saving color accent1

VM201:1 loading color capsid4
VM201:1 loading color accent2
VM201:1 loading color armor3

that's a different order.

what.

now to see if it's the same for kid dolls...

shit. shit.

it's adding colors to the palette. from the premade palettes. fuck.
